# Add security group and subnet into the resource group

This is the 3rd step to add security group and subnet into the resource group.

We did the authentication via Azure CLI as described by [Authenticating using the Azure CLI](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs/guides/azure_cli), and we will follow the following

- [azurerm_windows_virtual_machine](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/windows_virtual_machine)
- [azurerm_subnet](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/subnet)
- [azurerm_network_security_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/network_security_group)

This is based on top of the terraform files in "step_2_add_resource_in_rg".

Open a Bash.
